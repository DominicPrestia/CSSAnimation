CSS3 Animation Practice

I created this project so I could practice with the CSS3 animation techniques, but it also helped me really
understand how objects work and how they can be treated individually while acting together. 
UPDATE 9-9-15:
Educated myself on the value of arrays and found some useful functions today to help accomplish what I wanted
to with this project. JavaScript was the tough part, but now I get to come up with some creative animations!
